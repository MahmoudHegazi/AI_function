Ultimate dynamic try add new div with child and set size for parent and child

I created A fake database with all database features only for 1 session

## imporant (Invented new method)

*  IT can collect alot of info about the element and its parent and finally calculate and get the font size in EM
*  of child element in em, by the way no function until now do that tell your what font size of element in EM
*  I think w3c must add this  method to the core of HTML or any js framwork
